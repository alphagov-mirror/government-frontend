**Under current UK COVID-19 restrictions, you must stay at home. You must not leave home or travel, including internationally, unless you have a legally permitted reason to do so.** Check the [rules that apply to you in England](/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home), [Scotland](https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/), [Wales](https://gov.wales/covid-19-alert-levels) and [Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-regulations-guidance-what-restrictions-mean-you).

If you intend to [travel to England](/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england), [Scotland](https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-health-checks-at-borders/pages/testing-for-people-travelling-to-scotland/), [Wales](https://gov.wales/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-people-travelling-wales) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-international-travel-advice) from outside the Common Travel Area, including UK nationals returning home from travel abroad, you must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result taken up to 3 days before departure. This testing requirement does not apply to travel from Ireland.

Before you return to the UK you must [provide your journey and contact details](/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk). You must [self-isolate](/uk-border-control) when you enter the UK from any foreign country except Ireland, unless you have a valid exemption.

If you are legally permitted to travel abroad, [check our advice](/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus) on your [country of destination](/foreign-travel-advice). Some other countries have closed borders, and may further restrict movement or bring in new rules including testing requirements with little warning.
